## Additional code to be run on aws

1. what you need to know these promts for linux/ubuntu:

    You can replace the .pem file with yours then open the directory/command promt from where you saved the file usually to be placed on  (.ssh) folder.

    ```bash
    ssh -i "chumbacash-trading.pem" ubuntu@ec2-35-180-252-174.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com
    ```
    Crontab -e will promt when youre running on your machine you can select 1 (I don't remember exactly what it was but 1 is great)

    ```bash
    crontab  -e 
    ```
    In this shell file you need to edit and save the files you want to run e.g run.py , run_btc.py and many more you can place the files to run here and it will follow the crontab inputs to ensure that it runs the task programmed. 

    ```bash
    bash chumba-trading/code/run_envelope.sh
    ```
    nano is used to navigate into the (.py) scripts. while (ls) is used to check the files in a paticular folder within where you're
    cd is to navigate
    cp run.py run_btc.py is like cloning the run.py script and creating a run_btc.py using the script you just created

    ```bash
    nano
    ls
    cd 
    cp run.py run_btc.py
    ```
    This is used to run your scripts after a paticular time e.g in the below script it will be used to run the script on the start of each candle or beginning of the hour

    ```bash
    0 * * * * bash LiveTradingBots/code/run_envelope.sh >> LiveTradingBots/envelope.log 2>&1
    ```
